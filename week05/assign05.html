<!--
1. Create a webpage in your public_html/week05 directory named assign05.html. 
(This must be new web page with new content. You may not use any of your 
previous web pages.) This web page should look good on any device. It should 
provide a good user experience when accessed from a phone, tablet, or laptop.
2. (Done) `You must set the viewport in a <meta> tag.
3. You must include at least 5 images. As the web page scales up and down, 
text must wrap as necessary, and images must scale accordingly and not be 
cutoff.
4. You may choose to set a max-width to some of your images depending upon 
how large you want them to expand.
5. In addition to the images, your web page must include a <header>, 
   <footer>, and some text content.
6. Resize your web page to test its responsiveness.
7. When you resize your browser window from laptop size to phone size, you 
shouldnâ€™t lose any content. There should be no horizontal scrolling required 
to view content, no matter the browser window size. Only vertical scrolling 
is allowed.
8. All text must still be visible and should wrap and not be cut off. Images 
should shrink properly and not lose content.
9. There should be enough text that the responsiveness of the text at each 
screen size is obvious.
10. Create some responsive design CSS styles to use with your images and 
other content.
11. Hint: using max-width: 100%  and height: auto is very useful.
12. Flexbox must be used.
13. Media Queries must be used.
14. Validate your page using both the HTML5 validator (Links to an external 
site.) and the CSS validator (Links to an external site.). Update your 
index.html page with a link to the assignment.-->

      <p>Investing for the Retail Investor</p>
   </header>
   <div>
      <p>It is very unlikely that you are able to pick speculative securities that will make you alot of money before
         hitting your "Uncle Point", or the point where you can no longer afford to invest. How can you invest money as
         a
         retail investor without being about to ensure your portfolio with calls and puts?</p>
      <p>"Instead of putting your money into medium risk investments, you need to put a portion, say 85 to 90 percent in
         extremely safe instruments, like Tresury bills..."</p>
      <p>What Taleb calls elsewhere a "numaire repository of value" is composed of assets that have as little volatility
         as
         possible and are meant to store value.</p>
      <p>Short term US treasury bills are a good way to store value while gaining interest to combat the inflation of
         the
         dollar.</p>
      <img src="../images/tBills.jpeg">
      <p>Foreign currencies can be considered a hedge against the US government's defecit</p>
      <img src="../images/currencies.jpeg">
      <p>Bullion comes with storage considerations, but can be another good option for storing value. Gold has been used
         for thousands of years as a repository of value.</p>
      <img src="../images/bullion.jpeg">
      <p>"The remaining 10 to 15 percent you put in extremely speculative
         bets, as leveraged as possible, preferably venture capital-style portfolios...The average will be medium risk
         but
         constitutes a positive exposure to the Black Swan."</p>
      <p>By only having 10 percent in speculative investments, you have insured yourself from having a fall of more than
         10% while leaving a limitless upside.</p><img src="../images/bitcoin.png">
      <p>The reasoning behind this strategy is to allow you to make as many speculative bets as you can without ever
         having to
         give up. Rebalance whenever you want, sell some speculative stocks that have made money and buy more into your
         safe investments. If you lose money on a speculative investment, you can just keep it and make another bet. The
         result will be a convex curve, dipping at first before shooting up exponentially. Imagine having
         invested in bitcoin in 2016. Give yourself the ability to not worry about the dips</p>
