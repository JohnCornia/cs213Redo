1. (Done) Create a business website that consists of two web pages. 
Store the files for this site in a directory called week04 inside your public_html directory. 
Name the pages assign04.html and assign04_2.html.

2. (Done0The web site could be for a corporate web site, a small business site, an e-commerce site, or simply an entertainment site. 
Let your creative juices flow. However, be professional! 
These two web pages must use internal styles and external style sheets. 
Use the external styles to give the two web pages a consistent look and feel. 
Use the internal level styles for items unique to the individual web page.

3. (Done) Both web pages must reference the same external style sheet. 
Be sure your external style sheet has read privileges for the world (chmod 755 your.css), otherwise it won't work.

4. (Done) Your business web site's home page must have a link to the second page of the web site. 
Your second web page must have a link back to the home page.

5. You must include the following style features:

(i.e simple selectors, class selectors, and id selectors).
e. (Done) CSS to specify at least three different font families.
f. (Done) CSS to specify at least three different font sizes.
g. (Done) Different text colors.
h. (Done) Different background colors for different HTML elements (For example: you could make a <div> element have a different

         <p>This website is inspired by the "Incerto" book series by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. All the books of this series
            have to do
            with the unknowablility of the future. One of the books, "Antifragile," is named after a term coined by
            Taleb
            to describe something that not only is not affected by chaos, it is made better.</p>
         <img class="taleb" src="../images/download.jpeg" alt="Nassim Taleb">
         <p>The purpose of this website is to discuss how to put Taleb's philosophy into practice, since his book is
            very high level. I have tried to be comprehensive with respect to the aspects of life that antifragility
            should be applied to, but this is a work in progress.</p>
         <p>Use the left navigation to change to the various pages that have more information about becoming more
            antifragile. For now, most links are to books I am studying on the subject, but the self-sufficiency link
            will take you to some of my thoughts.
